6. docker exec

This command is used to access the running container

7. docker stop

Usage: docker stop <container id>

This command stops a running container

docker_stop - Docker Commands - Edureka

8. docker kill

Usage: docker kill <container id>

This command kills the container by stopping its execution immediately. The difference between ‘docker kill’ and ‘docker stop’ is that ‘docker stop’ gives the container time to shutdown gracefully, in situations when it is taking too much time for getting the container to stop, one can opt to kill it

9. docker commit

Usage: docker commit <conatainer id> <username/imagename>

This command creates a new image of an edited container on the local system
